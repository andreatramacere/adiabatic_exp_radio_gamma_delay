# Instructions to run the notebooks in the `jetset_sim_and_analysis`

The notebooks and the code in the folder: `jetset_sim_and_analysis` reproduce the analysis presented in Section 2,3,4,5,7, and Appendix C.

For questions or support, please contact andrea.tramacere[at]gmail.com

The version of jetset to use is 1.2.0rc11:
https://github.com/andreatramacere/jetset/releases/tag/1.2.0rc11

Since this is a pre-release, it is not published yet on conda and pip,
to install this version, you can use one of the methods described below:

- use the installation script in : https://github.com/andreatramacere/jetset-installer

OR

- install from source or binaries:
    1) from binaries: https://github.com/andreatramacere/jetset/wiki/install-release-from-binaries

    2) from source: https://github.com/andreatramacere/jetset/wiki/install-release-from-source

For some notebooks you will need to install the uncertainties  package: http://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/

## Instructions to run the notebooks 


The directory `expansion_tools` hosts some helper modules (no need to install), you just need to have this directory in the same directory where you run the notebooks

All the notebooks with simulations, already display the results of the simulations, but you have to rerun these notebooks, to be able to perform the analysis in the other notebooks.
To rerun the simulations (hosted in the notebooks with the `*_sim*` string, i.e. the one in items 1,2,3,4, and 5), you have to set `run=True` in cells of the notebook where this variable is defined. You will find a corresponding description in each cell of the simulation notebooks. Please, notice that products generated in 2 (`Flare_sim.ipynb`) are necessary to run 3  (`Expansion_sim_exp_vs_no_exp.ipynb`), 4 (`Expansion_sim.ipynb`) and 5 (`Expansion_sim_no_radiative_cooling.ipynb`).
Products generated in 6,7,8, and 9, are necessary to run the analysis in 10,11,12,13, and 14.

It is important to run the notebooks following the sequence as reported below.
