# Instructions to run the notebook in order to reproduce the analysis published in

The version of jetset is 1.2.0rc8, to install this version, follow these instructions:....

The directory `expansion_tools` hosts some helper modules (no need to install), you just need to have this directory in the same directory of the notebooks

## Description of the notebooks
